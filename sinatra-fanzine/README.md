# Sinatra-fanzine-project

## Objectives

Build a full scale Sinatra application that:

- Uses MVC
- Uses ActiveRecord
- Uses multiple models
- Use at least one has_many relationship on a User model and one     belongs_to relationship on another model
- Must have user accounts - users must be able to sign up, sign in , and sign out
- Validate uniqueness of user login attribute(username and emial)
- Once logged in, a user must have the ability to create, read, update and destroy the resource that belongs_to user.
- Ensure that users can edit and delete only their own resources - not resources created by other users
- Validate user input so bad data cannot be persisted to the database

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build Whirl Fanzine. 

You'll be building classes for User and Zine.

A user should not be able to take any actions, except for signing up, unless they are logged in. Once a user is logged in, they should be able to create, edit and delete their own fanzines, as well as view all the fanzines.
